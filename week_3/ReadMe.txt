My thesis is a dynamic web development project. I am using Node, Express, Heroku, MongoDB, Amazon S3, Pug, and React as my development engines. 

The project can be found at https://github.com/samchasan/thesis_app

It is also live at  https://chaffmap.com

I have many forms - from signing up, to loggin in, to adding and updating projects and other things. And through this process it has taken me about 8 weeks to fully grasp many of the fundamental elements of what I was doing. But recently I feel like I finally grasp the hang of it, and have finally passed the hump of understanding ‘why’ and am now asking often ‘how.’

In this way I can solve things and build them rather quickly, instead of spending time gaining knowledge simply to understand what the heck is happening. 

The big question that arises for me now is security. How can I verify users? How can I protect their data? How can I make sure my client side doesn’t have access to valuable information stored on the server? How to I protect from cross-site attacks? I don’t have time to worry about all these now, as I’m still building. But maybe it won’t be too hard? Not sure.
